## Ilford FP4 Plus 125

Technically speaking, Ilford FP4 Plus 125 is the only black-and-white Film Simulation Recipe made specifically for X-Trans V cameras—and it’s a very good Recipe! But, X-Trans IV B&W Recipes are also compatible with X-Trans V cameras, and of those Kodak Tri-X 400 is my all-time favorite. I definitely recommend that one, but Ilford FP4 Plus 125 is excellent, too.

## Kodak Portra 400 v2

Kodak Portra 400 v2 is a Recipe that does well at anytime during daylight hours, and as the name suggests it is a good option for portrait photography, but I’m going to recommend it specifically for “golden hour” near sunrise and sunset. This really could be your primary use-all-of-the-time Recipe, and that’s why I suggest placing it in C1, but when the sun is low to the horizon, make sure that this is the one you’re shooting with. I personally use this Recipe frequently.

## Timeless Negative

For natural light indoor photography, my top choice is the Timeless Negative Recipe (although any of the Recipes listed above this could work well, too). Timeless Negative is an all-rounder that could be used in most situations and produce excellent results, but specifically I’m recommending it for natural light indoor pictures. For artificial-light indoor images, use the recipes for nighttime photography below.

## 1970's Summer

You might be surprised that Kodachrome 64 didn’t make it to the top-spot on this category. I love that Recipe and think it’s a wonderful choice—don’t be afraid to choose it over this… or even over Kodak Portra 400 v2 for “golden hour” photography. Yet, for midday—which I’m defining as daylight that’s in-between the “golden hour” light of sunrise and sunset—I think 1970’s Summer is tough to beat. It’s not the most versatile Recipe, but if the sun is out, it’s an excellent option.

## CineStill 800T

This Recipe is a great option for after-dark photography, and it can sometimes produce interesting results in daylight situations, too.

CineStill 800T is a motion picture color negative film with the Remjet layer removed so that it can be developed in standard C41 chemistry. It’s actually repackaged Kodak Vision3 500T, which requires the ECN-2 development process. The “T” in the name means that it’s Tungsten-balanced, and is intended for use in artificial light; in daylight, it has a strong blue cast (unless you pair it with a color correction filter, such as Type 85), so most people use it at night. Because the Remjet layer has been removed, it’s prone to a blooming effect around bright light sources, such as streetlights.

It’s really difficult to accurately replicate a CineStill 800T aesthetic because there’s only so much that can be done to approximate certain aspects of it on Fujifilm cameras. As with any film, it can produce a lot of different looks depending on a host of factors, including how shot, developed, and scanned and/or printed. I feel that this Recipe does a pretty good job considering those factors, but I’ll be the first to admit that it’s not perfect. This isn’t a new Film Simulation Recipe, but a slight modification of the X-Trans IV CineStill 800T Recipe for use on X-Trans V models. The only change is that Color Chrome FX Blue has been adjusted from Strong to Weak, since X-Trans V renders blue more deeply on certain film simulations.

## Supra Xtra 400

I don’t yet have a “Tungsten” Film Simulation Recipe for X-Trans V, but that doesn’t mean you are out of luck. I’ve gotten good results at night with both Kodak Ultramax 400 and Timeless Negative, but Superia Xtra 400 is my favorite for after-dark photography. Superia Xtra 400 is also good for any of the C1-C4 situations mentioned above, as it’s a versatile Recipe—it’s another that could be your go-to for any situation. The two alternatives mentioned below are great options for golden hour or midday photography—I prefer both for that, and Pacific Blues is one of my absolute favorites—but I have also had decent results with those two Recipes at night, so they are worth your consideration (either in C5, or in C1 or C2).

## Kodak Ultramax 400

For dreary overcast, Kodak Ultramax 400 is my favorite option. It is a versatile Recipe, so it’s not just good for rainy days, but many other situations, too, including golden hour, midday, shade, indoor, nighttime and more. This could be your go-to Film Simulation Recipe. Emulsion ’86 and Thommy’s Ektachrome are very good runners up, and could also be alternatives for C2.
